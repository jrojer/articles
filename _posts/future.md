## Thinking about the future
### Is "future" an object?

There is no exact meaning of an object we name "future".
In terms of cognitive psychology future is an object in our mind. 
It's an image of possible outcomes we see from the perspective of current moment.

When is the future in the current moment? Surprisingly, it's in the present, in our mind.  
What does it mean "to see the future"? The events are never what we had expected.

We can talk about the future only in the terms of "possible" (of what may happen or may not happen).

What is **planning**? It's the seeing of steps from the point A to the point B, where point B is the **goal**.
When we make one step further towards the future, our vision of the future changes.

Personal strategy -- **understanding** of one's role and position in the event flow of the future, 
which allows to plan actions to meet the goal.
